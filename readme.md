# Python for managers | Challenge | 10-2021

## Hello!  

Welcome to the git repository for the 2021 python for managers ``#p4m`` hackaton.  
Here you can find all the necessary material for the ``#p4mchallenge``, which deals with outlier detection.  

This group was trained by Chabova Magdalena (Magdalena.Chabova@cz.bosch.com)

## Challenge Description: Quantity estimation by rail preassure

### Status
You are a functional software engineer for FIE-systems.  

To improve the quantity tolerance of the FIE your section manager asks you to develop a new software function that can estimate the injected quantity with an error smaller than 5% for quantities bigger than 180 mmÂ³. As the function is deployed to the ECU/vehicle it has to be robust for all influence parameters.  

Training and test data from a hydraulic testbench was measured by a colleague. The training data was already cleaned.  

Currently, there is no solution for this task. Up to now, all classic approaches could not solve the problem.  

### Your task

Write a program that estimates the injected quantity with an accuracy of 5% under all conditions.

### Remarks

As classic approaches failed, a machine learning approach should be used. For robustness, outlier detection should be implemented.

### Steps to solve the task

* Load the data
* Analyze the data regarding values, range, distribution, plot histogram and time plot
* Develop a plotting function to evaluate the relative error
* Implement a machine learning task (e.g. NN) for regression using training data
* Test the trained model with test data
* The function is not robust: so implement an outlier detection to kick out the input values of the test vector that are not similar to the training values.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository via the Anaconda prompt. If you have never worked with GitLab before, please use the clone via HTTPS option:  
```$ git clone https://code.exaas.bosch.com/p4m/challenges_08-2021/data-scientist-challenges/data-scientist-magdalena.git```  

2. Install all packages which are required for the challenge:
* Change your current directory to the repository folder: ```(base) $ cd data-sciencist-magdalena```  
* Create a virtual environment via Anaconda: ```(base) $ conda create -n p4m python=3.7.6 -y```
* Activate the environment: ```(base) $ conda activate p4m```
* Install the requirements via pip: ```(p4m) $ pip install -r requirements.txt```

Now you are ready to start hacking!  

### Starting jupyter-lab  

Start the jupyter-lab programming environment via the anaconda promt. Please make sure the (p4m) environment is activated.  
```(p4m) $ jupyter-lab```  
This comand will open your browser. In there you find everything that you need. Open a new jupyter notebook or a python script.  
Good luck with the challenge!

## Project Structure

Before you start coding take a moment to make yourself familiar with the project structure:  
``data/`` - Here you can find all relevant data which we will use to train our machine learning model.  
``notebooks/`` - The place for your notebooks (the go-to document for data scientists - it can be used to code, documentation as well as deliverable results). Every file ending with .ipynb goes in here.  
``scripts/`` - The place for raw python code, if you prefer not to use a notebook. Every file ending with .py belongs here.  
``references/`` -If you find additional material which is useful for a better understanding of the project, you can put these files here.  
``results/`` - Put your challenge results (e.g. result plots, trained models, ...) in here.  
``.gitignore`` - Can be ignored for now.  
``requirements.txt`` - File to setup and install all required python packages (See Installation and Setup).  
``README.md`` - The file you are reading right now.
